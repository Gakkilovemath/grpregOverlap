Description: Fit the regularization path of linear, logistic or poisson 
  models with overlapping grouped covariates based on the latent group lasso
  approach (Jacob, 2005). Latent group MCP/SCAD as well as bi-level selection
  methods such as the group exponential lasso, the composite MCP are also 
  available. This package serves as an extension of R package 'grpreg' (by 
  Dr. Patrick Breheny <patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu>) to deal with grouped variable
  selection involving overlaps.
