# overlap.grpreg

`overlap.grpreg` fits the regularization path of linear, logistic or poisson models with overlapping grouped covariates based on the latent group lasso approach (Jacob et al., 2005). Latent group MCP/SCAD as well as bi-level selection methods like the group exponential lasso (Breheny, 2015), the composite MCP (Huang et al., 2012) are also available. This package serves as an extension of R package `grpreg` (by Dr. Patrick Breheny <patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu>) to deal with grouped variable selection involving overlaps.
